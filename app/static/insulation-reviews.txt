Amazing for insulting walls

Wow I extortion
I know most companies are taking advantage of pricing right but this is getting ridiculous I have suppliers if I buy large quantities 40+ sheets 4x8 I am paying under 14 a sheet for 2 in foam Birch D4 38 a sheet 3/4 Last time I send a guy to HD 3-06-2024 300%wow

Easy to cut and install. Nice pink color adds a peaceful aura to the attic crawl space

10.5 r value in 2" had to lop the board into sections. Old drywall saw cut like warm butter. They paid for themselves.

Great way to help meet the new R30 wall insulation code in a 2 x 6 wall (plus R3 siding insulation), and easy to cut and work with.

Bulk pricing always a plus. Easy to cut/shape, love the 25psi. Used it for under slab insulation for a new building.

The rigid insulation was perfect for creating an insulated panel to isolate the heat transfer through my pull-down attic stairs.

This is the best insulation product on the market in my opinion. I see that it's saving us on energy, and will in the long run save me a lot of money. Easy to cut, manipulate, and install. It's not recommended to leave exposed but this product is so amazing, I left two sheets covering a drafty sliding glass door for 5 years in the elements and they held up very well! It will likely last the life of the house when installed properly.

Great insulation. Used it to seal up a few openings. Just wish we could buy it in 1/2 sheets... a whole sheet is too much for some projects.

useless scoring
the scoring at 16 and 24 inch is useless for typical walls with 16 or 24 inch stud spacing. the space between the studs is 14.5 and 22.5. then you must cut completely through the board to prevent it from snapping at the 16 or 24 in pre cut lines. I doubt very seriously they will fix this, but we will get a lame reply how the "team" will be notified.

It was easy to “score" with a long bladed xacto knife and a straight edge. We scored it deep and then with the foam board on a ridged table edge (a board on the tablesaws) pushed to snap it. It was light and easier to put on the ceiling. We kept it in place with some heavy duty double stick tape and then drywalled over.

Using it to build Halloween props. Perfect for my needs!

We bought this during the extreme cold event earlier this month in Maine. It was slightly too big to fit into our SUV and a nice young man working at the store cut it to size for us. The material was fine for our needs, but the service was outstanding!

We found this foam easy to cut to size with a battery powered skill saw. The panels easily adhered to 220 linear feet of full foundation wall with Locktite 300 foam adhesive. It took 3 novices four hours to do this job. Fantastic.

Crawl space and pump house
Used on two of my crawl spaces and pump house. I like it. Quite ridged, can be a little tough to cut and break cleanly. PLEASE for the love of all that is holy get rid of the precut lines, they never ever line up, ever, they just cause problems!!!
