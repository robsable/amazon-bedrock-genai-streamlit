I am an avid camper and this is the best price I have found for the two pack. The threads are tight and secure, - its a standard coleman tank you can buy anywhere but you will pay more at a sports store. Every year I stock up on these at Target when they come out in spring because they stop selling them towards the end of summer. I also keep a few around to get through the fall in case of power outages- they are great and last a long time.

I bought these online for pickup before a recent camping trip. It was a great value, and so nice to have a back up tank when we got to the campsite and discovered we couldn't build a campfire, and needed to use the campstove exclusively. I actually stocked up a few more since the 2-packs were such a good deal.

Coleman fuel cartridges have been a super-reliable fuel source for years. Camping and hiking trips, utility service outages, church picnics and natural disasters. (Hurricanes happen way more than we'd like here on the Texas Gulf Coast). Target's online ordering with store pickup is a fast and easy way to buy a 2-pack of Coleman fuel. I spent less than 5 minutes in the store to pick up my last order!

I purchased two Roadtrip LX Propane Grillers over ten years ago; the second one was for my parents. Both grills look and cook great, and are still going strong! They are used for grilling in the backyard, as well as tailgating and beach trips. We clean them and store after each use. This grill uses a one-pound propane fuel, or can be connected to a regular propane cylinder with the purchase of a hose (around $30). There is a grilling and a solid surface for cooking. It is a reliable Coleman product. Over a decade, our family has enjoyed this quality griller.
